====================== omschrijving van het probleem ======================

when I open my VScode via the anaconda prompt and navigate to the directory: 
(base) C:\Users\marloesbonenka\Documents>code .
it opens my instance of vs code correctly, and when i run a cell it manages to connect to python and a kernel in the interactive window. 
In the terminal, it does show some error messages:
(base) PS C:\Users\marloesbonenka\Documents> (& C:\Users\marloesbonenka\AppData\Local\anaconda3\Library\shell\condabin\conda-hook.ps1) ; (conda activate base)
&: The term 'C:\Users\marloesbonenka\AppData\Local\anaconda3\Library\shell\condabin\conda-hook.ps1' is not recognized as a name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or executable program.
Check the spelling of the name, or if a path was included, verify that the path is correct and try again.
usage: conda-script.py [-h] [-v] [--no-plugins] [-V] COMMAND ...

Invoke-Expression: Cannot bind argument to parameter 'Command' because it is an empty string.
(base) PS C:\Users\marloesbonenka\Documents> 
Then, when I navigate one directory further and open a VS code instance: 
(base) C:\Users\marloesbonenka\Documents>cd Python
(base) C:\Users\marloesbonenka\Documents\Python>code .
I can still connect to the kernel, but in the terminal the same message is shown. 
also, I am unable to load the module 'netcdf4', which i was able to load when accessing vs code in the above method.
when I launch vscode not from the anaconda prompt, but from anaconda navigator by clicking the 'launch' button, with the setting: all applications on base (root), which is my only environment, I am unable to activate the interactive window or even connect to python.
what is going on? please help me find out the cause of and solve these problems.

====================== mogelijke oplossingen ======================

The errors and issues encountered likely arise from these main causes:

1. The PowerShell error about 'conda-hook.ps1' not being recognized suggests there is a problem with conda initialization in PowerShell within VSCode. 
This usually happens if conda has not been fully set up to work in PowerShell, or the execution policy restricts running scripts. 
Running conda init powershell and restarting the terminal usually fixes this. 
Additionally, the PowerShell execution policy might need to be set to allow script execution using Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned run as administrator.

2. The problem where the 'netcdf4' module is not found when opening VSCode from inside the Python subdirectory, but works from the Documents directory, 
suggests a possible environment or path inconsistency. 
It might be that the Python interpreter or conda environment selected in VSCode is different or not activated correctly in the nested directory. 
Ensuring that the correct conda environment is selected in the VSCode Python interpreter and kernel list often solves this. 
Sometimes opening VSCode at the root directory with the full workspace helps VSCode locate the right environment and dependencies.

3. Launching VSCode from the Anaconda Navigator (with the base environment selected) but being unable to connect to the kernel or interactive window also suggests an environment/kernel selection issue. 
The Jupyter extension or Python extension in VSCode might not be properly selecting the conda environment or the ipykernel is missing or broken in that environment. 
Installing or reinstalling ipykernel in the base environment via conda install ipykernel and then restarting VSCode can help.

Summary of recommended steps to resolve the issues:

- Open a PowerShell terminal as Administrator.
- Run the command: conda init powershell
- Still in admin PowerShell, run: Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
- Restart VSCode and/or the terminal.
- In VSCode, open the folder at the root directory (like Documents) rather than a nested folder.
- Use the VSCode Python extension to explicitly select the conda environment interpreter associated with your base environment.
- Make sure the ipykernel package is installed in the base environment: conda install ipykernel
- In VSCodeâ€™s Jupyter/Interactive window, select the correct kernel.
- If netcdf4 cannot be found, reinstall it in the environment using conda install -c conda-forge netcdf4.

These steps address the PowerShell initialization error, the environment consistency that impacts package availability, 
sand the connection to the interactive Python kernel in VSCode launched from different starting points.

profile.ps1 location still refers to onedrive, could that be part of the issue?
