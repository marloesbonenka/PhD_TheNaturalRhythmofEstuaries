If you want to connect VScode with Github, after making local edits without being connected to your git repository:

1. In VScode, go to the folder that contains the scripts you want to upload to git
2. Make sure you are logged into git (lower left of VScode shows an avatar > click it to login)
3. Check if in the terminal, your path corresponds to the location of the scripts, so it should be the same as the folder path you navigated to in VScode
4. Initialize a git repository 
	git init
5. Add the remote GitHub repository: git remote add origin <your_url>
	in my case, <your_url>: https://github.com/marloesbonenka/PhD_TheNaturalRhythmofEstuaries.git
6. Create a new branch and switch to it 
	git checkout -b <branch_name> 
	e.g. local-edits
7. Stage and commit local files
	git add .
	git commit -m "Add local changes as a new branch"
8. Push branch to origin
	git push -u origin <branch_name>

Now that you have pushed your local branch to the remote repository, 
the next step to integrate your changes into the main branch is to merge your local branch into main.	

1. Switch to the main branch
	git checkout main
2. Make sure the main branch is up to date with the remote
	git pull origin main
3. Merge main and local branch
	git merge <branch_name>
	
If you are merging with a lot of conflicts and want to stop:
git merge --abort
