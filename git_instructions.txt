If you want to connect VScode with Github, after making local edits without being connected to your git repository:

1. In VScode, go to the folder that contains the scripts you want to upload to git
2. Make sure you are logged into git (lower left of VScode shows an avatar > click it to login)
3. Check if in the terminal, your path corresponds to the location of the scripts, so it should be the same as the folder path you navigated to in VScode
4. Initialize a git repository 
	git init
5. Add the remote GitHub repository: git remote add origin <your_url>
	in my case, <your_url>: https://github.com/marloesbonenka/PhD_TheNaturalRhythmofEstuaries.git
6. Create a new branch and switch to it 
	git checkout -b <branch_name> 
	e.g. local-edits
7. Stage and commit local files
	git add .
	git commit -m "Add local changes as a new branch"
8. Push branch to origin
	git push -u origin <branch_name>

Now that you have pushed your local branch to the remote repository, 
the next step to integrate your changes into the main branch is to merge your local branch into main.	

1. Switch to the main branch
	git checkout main
2. Make sure the main branch is up to date with the remote
	git pull origin main
3. Merge main and local branch
	git merge <branch_name>
	
If you are merging with a lot of conflicts and want to stop:
git merge --abort

If you fixed merging issues, don't forget to add the correct file to git before merging:
git add <file_location_wrt_maingitfile>

Git Reconnection & Sync Guide
Phase 1: Setup & Authorization
- Open Folder: In VS Code, open the root folder of your project.
- Verify Path: Ensure your terminal path matches your project folder.
- Fix Ownership (Nextcloud Fix): If Git gives a "dubious ownership" error, run: git config --global --add safe.directory <your_folder_path>
- Pause Sync: Crucial! Pause Nextcloud sync while performing Git operations to avoid "Invalid argument" errors.

Phase 2: Re-linking the Repository
- Initialize Git: git init
- Add Remote: git remote add origin https://github.com/marloesbonenka/PhD_TheNaturalRhythmofEstuaries.git
- Set Branch Name: Ensure your local branch is named main to match GitHub: git branch -M main

Phase 3: Merging & Resolving Conflicts
Because your local files and GitHub files now have "unrelated histories," a standard pull won't work.
- Fetch & Force Merge: This pulls the online version but automatically resolves all conflicts by choosing your local version as the "truth." git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories -X ours
- Stage All Changes: git add .
- Commit: git commit -m "Reconnected and kept local versions of all files"

Phase 4: Push to GitHub
- Upload: git push -u origin main
- Resume Sync: Turn Nextcloud back on.

Troubleshooting Shortcuts
- To see what is happening: git status
- To check connection: git remote -v
- If Push is rejected: If you are certain your local code is the correct version, you can force the update: git push origin main --force
- If a single file is locked: (Nextcloud error) Try git add --all. If it fails, close VS Code and any open scripts, then try again in a standard Windows Command Prompt or PowerShell.
